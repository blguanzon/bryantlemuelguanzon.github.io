        <div class="columns">

                <ol>
                    <li>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</li>
                    <li>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness 
                        of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, 
                        or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself 
                        to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting 
                        the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth 
                        generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them 
                        that love me, and keep my commandments.</li>
                    <li>Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD 
                        will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</li>
                    <li>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, 
                        and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: 
                        in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
                        nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 
                        For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, 
                        and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</li>
                    <li>Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
